# Readme-Generator

# Description
The goal of this project was to create a README Generator utilizing npms like inquirer and node.js. I learned how to makes the prompts in inquirer to work properly and once they were finished, generate a created README from said prompts that were given. I have also been learning alot on how to utilize the terminal itself instead of creating a README itself and type it out on the actual README. The difficulty in this project was around getting the license badges and to render in the badge and link to the created README file. Overall this project came out well,  I was able to generate a README in a terminal without having to write it out myself.
